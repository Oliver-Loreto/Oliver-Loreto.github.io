**Ingredients:** 
297 grams all-purpose flour  
42 grams cocoa powder  
4 grams (1 teaspoon) baking powder
1.5 grams (1/4 teaspoon) baking soda  
3 grams (1/2 teaspoon) salt   
1 gram carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)  
~~300 grams brown sugar~~ 250 grams brown sugar  
50 grams [invert sugar](/invert-sugar/)  
3 large eggs    
~~9 grams instant espresso powder~~ 15 grams espresso powder (whatever goes into the espresso machine works)    
5 grams vanilla extract (since this is being baked, vanillin works just as well)  
113 grams (4 ounces for buying purposes) unsweetened chocolate, chopped  
57 grams unsalted butter  
99 grams granulated sugar for coating  
57 grams confectioner's sugar for coating    

**Procedure:**  
1. Place oven rack in middle and preheat to 325F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Whisk flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, salt and CMC together in medium bowl. 
3. Whisk brown sugar, invert sugar, eggs, and espresso powder together in large bowl.
4. Melt chocolate and butter toghether using bain-marie or microwave method.   
4.1 Bain-Marie: Add chocolate and butter into bowl of bain-marie, heat at medium-high, stirring constantly until smooth and melted.  
4.2 Microwave: Combine chocolate and butter in bowl and microwave at 50 percent power, stirring occasionally, until melted, 2 to 3 minutes.  
5. Whisk chocolate mixture into egg mixture until combined. Fold in flour mixture until no dry streak remain. Let dough sit at room temperature for 25 minutes or until it is dry to the touch  
6. Place granulated sugar and confectionersâ€™ sugar in separate shallow dishes.  
7. Roll into balls (11 dough balls per sheet, 22 total), use a #30 scoop or 2-tablespoon measure for best results **weigh them next time**.
8. Drop prepared balls into granulated sugar, roll to coat.
9. Transfer to confectioner's sugar, roll to coat. Dust off excess before placing on sheet.
10. Evenly space balls on prepared sheets, 11 per sheet.
11. Bake 1 sheet at a time, for 12 minutes, rotating halfway through. Bake until puffed and cracked and edges have begun to set but centers are still soft (cookies will look raw between cracks and seem underdone)
12. Let cool completely on *sheet* before serving.
**Notes:**  
Replace ~15% of sugar w/ trimoline, add 1 gram carboxymethylcellulose per batch. Let rest ~25 minutes instead of 15, surface should have dry, taffy-like consistency.
